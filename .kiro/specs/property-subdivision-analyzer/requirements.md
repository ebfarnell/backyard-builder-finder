# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Property Subdivision Analyzer is a web-based application that helps developers and homeowners assess whether residential properties have sufficient space for subdivision and secondary unit development. Similar to solar installation analysis tools, this system uses polygon mapping and spatial analysis to determine if a property's backyard or lot area meets the minimum requirements for building additional dwelling units (ADUs) or subdividing the property.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a property developer, I want to input a property address and see if the lot is suitable for subdivision, so that I can quickly identify potential investment opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a valid property address THEN the system SHALL retrieve and display the property boundaries on a map
2. WHEN property boundaries are loaded THEN the system SHALL automatically detect the main structure footprint
3. IF the property data is successfully retrieved THEN the system SHALL display lot dimensions and total square footage
4. WHEN property analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL indicate whether the lot meets minimum subdivision requirements

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a homeowner, I want to see the buildable area of my backyard highlighted on a map, so that I can understand the development potential of my property.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system analyzes a property THEN it SHALL identify and highlight potential buildable areas using polygon overlays
2. WHEN buildable areas are identified THEN the system SHALL exclude setback requirements from building zones
3. WHEN displaying buildable areas THEN the system SHALL show different zones for primary structure, setbacks, and available building space
4. IF multiple buildable areas exist THEN the system SHALL rank them by size and development feasibility

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to adjust polygon boundaries manually, so that I can account for specific site conditions or preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the property analysis THEN the user SHALL be able to click and drag polygon vertices to modify boundaries
2. WHEN polygon boundaries are modified THEN the system SHALL recalculate buildable area in real-time
3. WHEN changes are made THEN the system SHALL update subdivision feasibility assessment automatically
4. IF polygon modifications create invalid geometries THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback and prevent invalid shapes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see zoning and regulatory constraints overlaid on the property map, so that I can understand legal limitations for development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a property is analyzed THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant zoning information for the location
2. WHEN zoning data is available THEN the system SHALL display setback requirements, height restrictions, and lot coverage limits
3. IF local ADU regulations exist THEN the system SHALL incorporate these rules into the feasibility analysis
4. WHEN regulatory constraints are applied THEN the system SHALL show compliant vs non-compliant areas clearly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate a development feasibility report, so that I can share analysis results with stakeholders or use for planning purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the user SHALL be able to generate a PDF report with property details and findings
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include property dimensions, buildable area calculations, and regulatory compliance status
3. IF the property is suitable for development THEN the report SHALL include estimated unit sizes and development recommendations
4. WHEN reports are generated THEN they SHALL include high-quality map images and professional formatting

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save and retrieve previous property analyses, so that I can track multiple properties and compare opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a property analysis THEN they SHALL be able to save the results to their account
2. WHEN viewing saved analyses THEN the user SHALL see a list with property addresses, analysis dates, and feasibility status
3. IF a user has saved analyses THEN they SHALL be able to re-open and modify previous assessments
4. WHEN managing saved properties THEN the user SHALL be able to delete, rename, or export individual analyses
